> GL-assisted Drawing Environment

Glade is a library for writing graphical applications with WebGL in Javascript that can run in the browser, or natively on Darwin (macOS). The idea is that you can use the normal, browser-friendly [WebGL interfaces](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext) like WebGL2RenderingContext to draw to a context, whether that context is in a canvas HTML element, or in a GLFW native window.
