> GL-assisted Drawing Environment

Glade is a library for writing graphical applications with WebGL/WebGPU in Javascript that can run in the browser, or natively on Darwin (macOS) via OpenGL and Dawn. The idea is that you can use the normal, browser-friendly [WebGL interfaces](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext) and [WebGPU interfaces](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) to draw to a context, whether that context is in a canvas HTML element, or in a GLFW native window.
