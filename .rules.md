# Development Rules

## Package Architecture

- All packages export through `{package_name}.ts` for portability
- Use relative paths for local imports, package names for package imports
- Every package has `package.json` (regardless of language)

## Planning

- Focus only on immediate goal changes
- Ignore backward compatibility and deprecations
- Do not plan migrations unless explicitly requested

## General Code Quality

- Comments explain "why", not "what" - only for non-obvious code
- No emojis in code or comments
- Minimal, focused logging
- Follow existing project structure and patterns

## TypeScript/JavaScript

### Type Safety

- Never use `any`, or `as`, and avoid `as unknown`
- Use proper type guards and type assertions
- Prefer `type` over `interface`

### Imports & Dependencies

- Module-level imports only (no dynamic imports or requires)
- Static imports at the top of files

### Error Handling

- Never catch errors only to log them - handle or re-throw
- Proper error handling with meaningful feedback

### Code Style

- Double quotes for strings
- Always use braces for conditionals
- Never single-line return statements
- Use `??` for null/undefined checks, `||` for falsy checks
- No shebangs in TypeScript files

### Examples

- Concise with minimal verbose output
- No `satisfies` operators in examples
