        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          No. This was built mostly as a way to learn about WebGPU, GUIs, graphics programming, and how different rendering modes and painting lifecycles for UIs work. That being said, with a small team of engineers knowledgeable in graphics programming, you could probably get this production ready in about two and a half weeks.

        <h3 class="mb-3 text-xl text-gray-900">Is Glade actively maintained?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Not really. There are plans to update it here and there and generally try to improve it, but not a significant amount of time or effort is being put into this library. If you have a change, feel free to submit a PR and email benjvogt@gmail.com.

        <h3 class="mb-3 text-xl text-gray-900">Do I have to use Bun?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          At the moment, yes. While the FFI and dynamically linked libraries could be authored as Node modules, it's more work than the current Bun setup. Also, when it comes to embedding, Bun makes it way easier than Node does. At the moment there's no interest in rewriting this to accommodate Node. Bun works well.

        <h3 class="mb-3 text-xl text-gray-900">Does Glade support Apple emojis?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Technically, yes. The Apple emoji TTF file can be embedded and it renders perfectly. However, that is a 200 megabyte file, which is challenging to embed or load in a web deployment or a native deployment. And more importantly, that is a copyrighted file. The way Apple does it, their custom renderer will actually fetch individual PNGs and render them on the frontend. If you want to do that, that's up to you.

      <div>
        <h3 class="mb-3 text-xl text-gray-900">Does Glade support Windows or Linux?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          At the moment, no. But GLFW and Dawn both support Windows and Linux, so it really wouldn't be a significant amount of work to add packages like we do with macOS and simply implement the interface for event handling, window handling, and all of the other native functions like clipboard and text selection. The reason this hasn't been done is just because it's a lot of work and there isn't a Windows machine available, and it's a significant amount of scaffolding to set up to even test that out.

      <div>
        <h3 class="mb-3 text-xl text-gray-900">Why did you choose WebGPU?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Initially this worked with OpenGL/WebGL. But WebGPU has come a long way and has a lot of interesting features. It's easier to use. That being said, there's nothing specific at the application level or component level that requires WebGPU. In theory, you could swap out the macOS platform implementation with Metal or something like that, and only use WebGPU for the browser. This would create a larger surface area for the platform interface, which would have to be implemented on those respective platforms (native and web), but it's certainly possible. Writing native shader code in Metal or WebGPU or OpenGL or whatever you'd like to use for Windows and Linux is definitely possible, and there's an increasing number of GUI libraries that do this. But it seemed challenging for a first pass.

      <div>
        <h3 class="mb-3 text-xl text-gray-900">Have you built any applications with this library?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          No. Mostly just working through the components and elements, trying them out as they're built. Again, this is not production ready.
